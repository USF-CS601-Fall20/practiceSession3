// Fill in code in class HourlyEmployee so that it is a subclass of Employee
// and has an additional variable numHours.
// The salary for this kind of employee has a different meaning:
// it is an hourly salary.
// Provide a constructor.
// There should also be a method to add hours.
// The class should override the pay method to return salary*numHours and
// after payment, reset numHours to 0.
// This example was modified from the example in Java Software Solutions book.
public class HourlyEmployee {
